## Cheesemonger

For the past seven years, I have made a living selling cheese. In that time I have cut over 130 wheels of Parmigiano-Reggiano and thousands of pounds of Cheddars, Goudas, blues and Bries. But it is not the quantity that is impressive; it is the number of everyday interactions concerning specific components of information that make cheesemongering such a [unique skill](https://psibir.github.io/article/What-Cheesemongers-Bring-To-The-Table/) with surprising cross-domain applications.
