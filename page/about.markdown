I am a former cheesemonger turned software developer with a passion for leveraging technology to solve complex problems. As an experienced professional in the cheese industry, I developed a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the importance of providing exceptional customer experiences.

My career change into software development has allowed me to merge my love for technology and cheese, and I am excited to share some of the projects that showcase my skills and knowledge. This portfolio features a range of projects that highlight my proficiency in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

Whether you are an employer seeking to fill a software development position or a fellow developer looking for inspiration, I invite you to explore my portfolio and see how I can contribute to your organization. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to hearing from you!
