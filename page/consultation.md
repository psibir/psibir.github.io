# Need Help?

## you can't do it alone

Executing a vision is hard. I am here to help you whether you are seeking a brainstorming session regarding optimizing existing process or troubleshooting errors at any stage of your project.

Based on what I noticed during my 7 years in Specialty Retail across a wide variety of teams and projects, you are likely losing time and money every day right now at your company. I can identify these losses for you and create a detailed report with recommendations. You can then choose to implement them yourself, hire someone else, or hire me. You can't do it alone. Good thing you don't have to.

If you want to develop your next idea, contact me via the [webform](https://psibir.github.io/page/contact/) or by [email](mailto:bloomfieldtm@gmail.com).
