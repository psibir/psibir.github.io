Hi, I’m Trevor! I'm a web developer and data analyst. In a nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website navigation and layout to a company's web hosting and security architecture. My expertise lies within Python scripting, and the main languages in my tech stack are Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong learner and love to read, bike, and eat curry.
