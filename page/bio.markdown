Hi, I’m Trevor! I'm a self-taught web developer and data analyst. In a few words, I create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. My expertise lies in analytical thinking and Python scripting. The main languages in my tech stack are Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong learner and love to read, bike, and eat curry.
