I am a former cheesemonger turned software developer with a passion for leveraging technology to solve complex problems. As an experienced professional in the cheese industry, I developed a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the importance of providing exceptional customer experiences. 

With a keen eye for detail and a deep appreciation for the power of data, I have developed a range of software projects that showcase my ability to apply cutting-edge technology to real-world challenges. From developing a cheese recommendation engine that delivers personalized recommendations based on user input, to creating a dynamic inventory management system that streamlines the ordering and tracking of cheese products, my projects highlight my ability to leverage data and technology to drive business success.
