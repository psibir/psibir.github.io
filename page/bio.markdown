As a passionate cheesemonger, I have spent years honing my skills in selecting, aging, and presenting the finest artisanal cheeses to discerning customers. However, I have also been drawn to the world of software development, and I have worked hard to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in this field.

With a keen eye for detail and a deep appreciation for the power of data, I have developed a range of software projects that showcase my ability to apply cutting-edge technology to real-world challenges. From developing a cheese recommendation engine that delivers personalized recommendations based on user input, to creating a dynamic inventory management system that streamlines the ordering and tracking of cheese products, my projects highlight my ability to leverage data and technology to drive business success.
