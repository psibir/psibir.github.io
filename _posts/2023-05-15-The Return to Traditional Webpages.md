Social media platforms are [no longer useful for finding reliable information](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2022/07/22/teens-increasing-rely-on-social-media-for-newsbut-they-dont-trust-it/?sh=f5a981119ff5). Many people feel trapped in the obligations and limitations of these platforms. A growing trend of users are turning back to traditional webpages. These websites are simple, easy to read, and offer a straightforward online experience. Let's explore why users prefer these websites over social media.
### Disappointments of Social Media
Social media platforms were once great for connecting and discovering content. But now, they're filled with ads, clickbait, and algorithms that control what we see. It's tiring to sift through all the noise.
### Freedom from Closed Systems
The frustration with social media's closed ecosystems is another reason for the rise of traditional webpages. Users want access to various sources of information, not just one platform. Being dependent on a single vendor limits creativity and narrows perspectives.
### Embracing Simplicity
Social media has evolved into an amalgam of notifications about alerts, menudiving expeditions for privacy controls, and endless scrolling for good content. Traditional webpages provide a respite from the clutter and noise. They focus on delivering quality content without distractions. These websites prioritize user experience with easy navigation, clean layouts, and well-organized information. 
### Authenticity and Trust
It's hard to tell what is real and what is manipulated on social media platforms (hint: all of it is [manipulated](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-01-13-social-media-manipulation-political-actors-industrial-scale-problem-oxford-report)). In contrast, traditional webpages strive for accuracy, transparency, and credibility. While the creators and community are not immunite to bias or experimenting on their readers, the simple website builds a stronger connection between the creators and their audience and functions to provide its own social experience through engaging content.
### Regaining Individuality
Social media platforms often make everyone look the same with their standard templates. There is nothing wrong with standard, but even small design changes in [typography](https://thefutur.com/content/how-typography-can-influence-a-reader) communicate your message to the reader with greater impact. Traditional webpages give individuals and organizations a chance to be unique and establish their own digital presence. Customizable designs, personalized branding, and the freedom to express oneself allow for a rediscovery of individuality.
### Decentralizing Network Effects
Social media has persisted such poor design due to its network effects. Developers designing multiple simple and intriguing webpages offer a pathway towards decentralization, allowing users a chance to break free from sales funnels and ideological pipelines. In this case, context-switching from site to site is a feature to break user's idle online behavior looping through the same actions. Expanding past the 'walled garden' of social media of not only breaks the stranglehold of large corporate entities but also enables the exploration of unique and independent digital spaces.
### Community Development
Content providers hosting independently from large networks are able to foster vibrant communities that develop their own online culture. Social media platforms suffer from content and interactions that are often diluted by the platform's features and policies. Traditional webpages enable a more authentic and community-driven experience. Good communities nurture good content.
### Conclusion
Users seeking simplicity, authenticity, and freedom; they are turning back to simple webpages. These websites offer a clutter-free experience, valuable information, and a personalized journey. By embracing the return of simple webpages, developers can reshape the digital landscape to provide accessible and valuable web experiences.
