Have you ever found yourself struggling to come up with new project ideas? Look no further! Today, we're excited to introduce nounseed, a Python script that generates and stores project ideas based on a list of nouns. With nounseed, you'll never run out of inspiration for your next project.

You can find the link to the Github repo for nounseed [here](https://github.com/psibir/nounseed).

## How nounseed Works

At the core of nounseed is the `NounSeeder` class. This class is responsible for loading the nouns, generating project ideas, and storing them. By leveraging the power of Python, nounseed simplifies the process of idea generation. Let's take a closer look at its features:

### 1. Loading Nouns

The `NounSeeder` class provides a convenient method, `load_nouns`, to load a list of nouns from a CSV file. Simply prepare a CSV file named `nounlist.csv`, with each noun on a separate line, and nounseed will handle the rest.

### 2. Generating Project Ideas

Using the loaded list of nouns, the `NounSeeder` class can generate project ideas by combining two randomly selected nouns. This ensures that each idea is unique and interesting. Rest assured, nounseed takes care of making sure there are always enough nouns available for generating ideas.

### 3. Selecting Project Ideas

To streamline the idea selection process, nounseed offers the `select_project_ideas` function. It prompts you to choose project ideas by entering their corresponding numbers. If you prefer, you can also enter 'view' to see the stored ideas.

### 4. Storing Project Ideas

Once you have selected the project ideas you like, nounseed allows you to store them for future reference. The `store_project_ideas` function saves the selected ideas in a CSV file named `storednouns.csv`. Each idea is stored on a separate line, making it easy to manage and review your collection of ideas.

### 5. Viewing Stored Ideas

Curious about the project ideas you've saved? nounseed has you covered. The `view_stored_ideas` function displays the stored project ideas directly from the `storednouns.csv` file. It's a great way to revisit your ideas and spark inspiration whenever you need it.

## How to Use nounseed

Getting started with nounseed is a breeze. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: nounseed requires Python 3.x, as well as the built-in `csv` module and the `pathlib` module. If you don't already have Python installed, make sure to do so before proceeding.

2. **Prepare the Noun List**: Create a CSV file named `nounlist.csv` and populate it with one noun per line. This list will serve as the basis for generating project ideas.

3. **Run the Script**: Open your command line interface, navigate to the directory where nounseed is located, and execute the `main.py` script using Python. You can optionally provide the `-n` or `--num-ideas` argument to specify the number of project ideas to generate. The default is 10.

   ```shell
   python main.py -n 10
   ```

4. **Follow the Prompts**: nounseed will generate a list of project ideas and display them, along with corresponding numbers. Enter the numbers of the project ideas you wish to store, separating them with commas. Alternatively, you can enter 'view' to see the stored ideas.

5. **View Stored Ideas**: If you choose to view the stored ideas, nounseed will display them for you. These ideas are stored in the `storednouns.csv` file.

6. **Exit the Program**: Once

 you have made your selections, nounseed will gracefully exit.

## Configuration Options

nounseed provides a few configuration options to customize its behavior:

- `STORED_NOUNS_FILE`: This variable specifies the name of the CSV file where the selected project ideas will be stored.
- `CSV_FILE`: This variable determines the name of the CSV file containing the list of nouns.

Feel free to modify these variables in the script to suit your preferences. You can customize the filenames or even change the file paths as needed.

**Note:** To ensure correct functionality, please make sure to place the `main.py` script in the same directory as the `nounseed` package directory. This way, the relative imports will work seamlessly.

## Dependencies

nounseed relies on the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x: The script is written in Python and requires Python 3 or higher to run.
- `csv` module: nounseed utilizes the built-in `csv` module for reading and writing CSV files.
- `pathlib` module: The script uses the `pathlib` module for file operations and path manipulation.

Make sure you have these dependencies installed on your system before running nounseed.
