Language is a powerful tool that allows us to express our thoughts, convey meaning, and communicate with one another. However, linguistic phenomena such as errors of speech or malapropisms can reveal deeper layers of meaning and subconscious preoccupations. This essay explores the concept of a specific type of speech error known as split infinitive lapsus — where split infinitives are used erroneously — and examines how they signify repressed content hidden beneath the surface of speech. 

The unintentional splitting of an infinitive indicate a cognitive dissonance or tension between the intended meaning and an underlying, repressed desire. It serves as a small marker of a deeper psychological or emotional preoccupation that the speaker may be unaware of or hesitant to express directly.  Analyzing the significance of these linguistic slips gives us an opportunity to examine underlying preoccupations and unconscious associations.

### Examples

A split infinitive occurs when an adverb or other word is inserted between the infinitive marker "to" and the base form of a verb. A well-known example of how this sounds is in the opening monologue to every episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation in the sentence "to boldly go where no man has gone before.” Here, the adverb ‘boldly’ splits the infinitive ‘to go’, a marked distinction in contrast to the formal cadence and diction of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. While split infinitives are considered grammatically incorrect by traditional standards, their usage can sometimes reveal underlying psychological or emotional states. For our Star Trek example, this reflects the [Overview Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect) faced by Captain Picard from beholding the vast expanse of space. While this split infinitive works well within the confines of a monologue, many of those who speak in split infinitives are distracted not only from awe but from the entire range of emotions whose residues inflect a certain mood to the speaker.

Another example would be a philosophy student seeking a positive letter of  recommendation from a prior professor and the professor stammers “Well, the candidate really does have a great command of the English language!” Here, we have hedging language in the initial ‘well…’, and an infinitive ‘have’ is split by the word ‘really.’ Additionally, the auxiliary verb ‘does’ is also splitting the infinitive. Combined with the strained excitement of the exclamatory, one could surmise the professor does not have great confidence in the abilities of the philosophy candidate.

## Preoccupied Associations Demand Separation

Split infinitive lapsus can be seen as a manifestation of repressed content and distorted associations related to the specific verb and adverb being used. The choice of adverb, which interrupts the infinitive, may reflect an underlying preoccupation or desire associated with the action denoted by the verb. One must exercise caution in drawing definitive conclusions from split infinitives alone, but they can serve as a starting point for deeper analysis. 

Examining the context and frequency of split infinitives in an individual's speech patterns, one may identify recurring themes or hidden motivations.  As seen in our Star Trek example, a person who frequently uses split infinitives when discussing risk-taking activities may harbor an unacknowledged yearning for adventure or a subconscious fear of monotony. Similarly, someone who splits infinitives when describing personal achievements might be driven by an unspoken need for validation. 

These speech errors function as a subconscious attempt to separate certain elements within the verb phrase. The speaker inserts an adverb or adverbial phrase and creates a division within the infinitive verb phrase, emphasizing the importance or significance of the adverb itself as an attempt to overshadow the meaning smuggled in by their verb choice. The will for separation reflects a desire to draw attention to or away from a specific aspect of a subject to which the speaker refers. It is likely that the “choice” to split an infinitive is not a choice at all and can unveil an underlying psychological tension or preoccupation of which the speaker may not be consciously aware. Over time, these mental blocks ossify and entrench thought patterns that the speaker is compelled to repeat. 

In a way, the verb phrase is transformed into a signifier that points to other signifiers by way of revealing the speaker’s intent by what the the speaker is *not* saying. Like a pregnant pause, there is meaning that has yet to be verbalized but was gesticulated towards in the act.

### Conclusion

Malapropisms such as the split infinitive lapsus offer a unique opportunity to peek into the hidden features of language and the human psyche. These linguistic slips act as small markers of repressed content and underlying preoccupations, revealing unconscious associations and desires. Giving specific attention to the significance of split infinitive lapsus, the context in which they are used, and the prior experiences of the speaker and listener allows a deeper understanding of the complexities of human communication and the (not so) hidden layers of meaning that lie on the surface of speech. These linguistic phenomena serve as reminders that language is not only a tool for expression but also a gateway to the inner workings of the human mind.
