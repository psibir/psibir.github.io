I am excited to announce the launch of nwa-resources, a new community resource that provides information on social services in Northwest Arkansas. As a member of this community, I recognized the need for a centralized source of information on social services, such as financial assistance, housing, food pantries, and low-income medical and dental providers.

## Why NWA?

Northwest Arkansas is a region that has experienced significant growth and development in recent years, but with that growth comes challenges. One of those challenges is the increasing wealth disparity between the affluent and working-class residents. As the region continues to attract large corporations and businesses, there is a growing concern about the detrimental effects on the lower-income population, particularly in terms of access to basic needs like housing, food, and medical care.
This is where social services play a critical role in addressing these issues.

## Why digital? 

When it comes to accessing information about social services, the digital age has certainly made things easier for many people. In particular, certain populations may prefer digital resources over physical pamphlets for a number of reasons.
For one, digital resources are often more accessible to those with disabilities. Physical pamphlets may not be designed with accessibility in mind, whereas digital resources can be optimized for use with screen readers, magnifiers, and other assistive technologies.
Additionally, digital resources are more convenient for some who lack transportation or live in rural areas. Rather than having to physically travel to a government office or other location to pick up a pamphlet, residents can access the information they need via the Internet.
