For this project, i tried to make something that had practical usability at my job. 

Thinking of new sandwiches gets old and you get stuck in patterns. Thats where the sandwich-generator steps in.

Faster than picking names out of a hat, easier than thinking of combinations in rapid succession. This chef's aid comes in handy for the amateur and the enterprise user alike!

Alright, enough of the pitch. What really sells this fantastic tool is the ease of adding new ingredients via a CVS file database, easily edited in spreadsheet software. While that may limit its capacity, it does not limit its capability.

It works by using the ```random``` and  ```csv``` libraries to randomly select cheeses, meats, vegetables, and condiments read from ingredients.csv which contains four columns.

A user can repeatedly generate new sandwiches, picking the ones they like and slightly modifying the ones that spark inspiration. In this way, a chef can capidly prototype new sandwiches from their inventory.
