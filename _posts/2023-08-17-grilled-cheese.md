In my time as a cook, I have developed a process to make high-quality grilled cheese sandwiches. Each step enhances an aspect of flavor, texture and consistency of the melt by applying different forms of direct and indirect heat.

Equipment

-   Grill
-   Air-fryer
-   Knife
-   Cutting Board

Ingredients

-   Bread
-   Butter
-   Cheese

Process

-   **Chop** cheese into small cubes to increase surface area
-   **Warm** butter slightly before spreading 
-   **Apply** butter on the entire surface of one side of bread
-   **Place** buttered bread on grill or frying pan preheated at 490F
-   **Let** butter melt into bread for about 30 seconds
-   **Flip** bread over and soak up the excess butter with the unbuttered side
-   **Fry** for ~1 minute until bottom of bread is hard enough to scratch with your spatula
-   **Flip** bread over again and **layer** chopped cheese on the crispy side of the bread
-   **Fry** for ~2 minutes, checking occasionally for overcooking
-   **Remove** toast with cheese from grill and **place** in air-fryer for 2 minutes to melt cheese, keeping the other piece of bread on the grill
-   **Remove** toast with cheese from air-fryer and **place** on top of the toasted bread on the grill
-   **Flip** sandwich upside down and **fry** for 30 seconds
-   **Remove** from grill and **cut** grilled cheese sandwich diagonally
-   **Enjoy**
