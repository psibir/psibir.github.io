I have made the first few commits for an extractive text summarizer. A good amount of it was assembled via a tutorial, but I cleaned up the output and streamlined variable use so it does not require editing the script itself to produce a summary. I also got practice with writing documentation of functions. Understanding the control flow was my personal goal with completing it and its the thought that counts, right? you can find it [here](https://github.com/psibir/text-summarizer)

Difficulties this week were with Django, as I have two half-finished websites that will probably remain as such. Luckily they still served a purpose as a good exercise in developing muscle memory for migrations and troubleshooting. Failure has always been my greatest teacher.

I have found YouTube to be an extremely low-density source of information and a very-not-good method of learning anything related to development. Necessity is the mother of invention, however. I'd rather see how far i can push static sites using Jekyll, the framework that belay this blog. 

The greatest change has been my IDE, as I have moved from using PyCharm to VSCode. I have been wary of Microsoft products for some time, but it is a fantastic tool. I am sure i will find my qualms with it soon (oh yeah, setting up virtual environments caused a few hours of headaches today) but I enjoy how slick it looks. 

I have also further customized my terminal with a nifty prompt (-> instead of username@workstation), generated from [this website](https://zsh-prompt-generator.site). It seems like a small change, but it greatly increases my screen real estate (now I know why a 13-inch monitor can be a pain) and it is a small comfort that makes me feel like I am learning something.
